Description:

The program is a command line script that downloads audio, a single video or an entire playlist from YouTube based on the input search request, it allows the user to specify the desired channel and also creates a directory under the user's "Documents" folder (Windows 10) in which to store the saved files - the name of the folder is specified by the user under the content category prompt.


Requirements:

The script uses ffmpeg to process the audio/video(s) and so this software package must be installed on the system. A good ffmpeg installation guide for Windows 10 is provided by the following link (YouTube video tutorial); https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r1AtmY-RMyQ
